    "# Implementing a Stack with a Singly Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate use of a singly linked list by providing a complete Python implementation of the stack ADT (see Section 6.1). In designing such an implementation, we need to decide whether to model the top of the stack at the head or at the tail of the list. There is clearly a best choice here; we can efficiently insert and delete elements in constant time only at the head. Since all stack operations affect the top, we orient the top of the stack at the head of our list.\n",

    "To represent individual nodes of the list, we develop a lightweight Node class.\n",
